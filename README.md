## Title: React Context API: Simplifying State Management

# Introduction:
React Context API is a powerful tool provided by React to manage state in an application. It alleviates the need for prop drilling, making it easier to pass data down the component tree. In this blog, we'll dive deep into the Context API, explore its capabilities, and see how it can be used to simplify state management in React applications.

# What is Context API?
Context API is a part of the React library that allows you to share data between components without having to pass props explicitly at every level of the component tree. It provides a way to create global state accessible to any component in the application without using complex state management libraries like Redux or Mobx.

# Getting Started:
To use the Context API, you need to create a Context object using React.`createContext()` method. 
- This Context object consists of two components: `Provider and Consumer`.

# Example:
Let's consider a simple scenario of a user profile page. We want to display the user's name and email in different components without prop drilling.

# Path Structute
Here's a possible path structure for the React project using the Context API for state management:

```sql

  ├── src/
  │   ├── components/
